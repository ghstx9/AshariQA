I was inspired by IslamQA, the first Islamic fatwa website that ever existed on the Internet. But the fatwa that are given on the website are based upon the Salafi movement and the Athari creed. And so, i've decided to make a counterpart which instead of using the Athari creed, this will be based upon the Ashari creed.

And today i've uploaded the first ever version of AshariQA.


(Note that this is a silly project i've made out of boredom, if you're offended by it then get a grip you Salafi cuck.)
